                        Hellow everyone, my name is David S. I am a computer science major. I have always had an interest in technology, even more
                        so because at this point the entire world revolves around it. I got interested in computer science specifically 
                        during highschool. When I saw they had a CSS class available I decided to take it and my interest grew even more. I am
                        now attempting to complete a degree in this field and expand my career options. Since technology is ever evolving there
                        will always be fun new ways to interact with it. My main goal currently is just to graduate and get my degree, secondary goal
                        would be to get a job in the field. I like to learn new things, I am currently attemtping to learn the guitar although I am no
                        good at it. I also like to play video games, which is where most of my creativty is inspired from. I also used to draw, although
                        that hobby has been retired for a while now.
