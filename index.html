                        <p>
                            My mission at Olive Branch Baby Care is to extend a helping hand during one of life's most 
                            profound transitions. I believe that the early weeks of parenthood shouldn't be defined by 
                            stress, but by supported growth. My objective is to ensure your transition is as smooth as 
                            possible by providing evidence-based information and hands-on care tailored to your family's 
                            unique needs. Whether I am offering a listening ear for your birth story, troubleshooting newborn 
                            sleep, or simply keeping your home running smoothly while you rest, I am there to bridge the gap 
                            between 'surviving' and 'thriving.' I don't just care for your baby; I can offer collaborative 
                            guidance that will support your parenting intuition.

                        <p>
                            With a background in Child Development from SJSU and a decade of experience in both formal 
                            education and private childcare, I understand that the first few weeks of life are a sacred 
                            time of discovery. My transition into postpartum care was born from a desire to support the most 
                            intimate needs of a growing family. I'm here to offer the solutions, education, and peace of mind 
                            you deserve.
