                        <p>
                             Hi, I'm Albina Soto. My journey into postpartum care began at San Jose State University, 
                             where I studied Child Development. For the past decade, I've dedicated my career to the 
                             "under-five" journey-spending years in both formal educational settings and providing 
                             personalized childcare. I've seen firsthand the magic of a child's discovery, but I've also 
                             seen how much parents need a "village" of their own.

                            While my years as a nanny have been dedicated to nurturing the individual needs of children, 
                            my transition into postpartum care has a new, vital objective. At Olive Branch Baby Care, I 
                            believe that the best way to ensure a child's future success is to nurture and equip the parents 
                            first.

                            By providing you with evidence-based solutions, a listening ear, and practical support during 
                            the fourth trimester, I help create a stable, peaceful environment. My goal is to empower you 
                            with the confidence and tools you need today, so your children can thrive in the years to come.
                        </p>
