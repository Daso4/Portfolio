                            <h3> My Mission </h3>
                            <p> 
                                My mission at Olive Branch Baby Care is to extend a helping hand during one of life’s most profound transitions. 
                                I believe that the early weeks of parenthood shouldn't be defined by stress, but by supported growth. My objective 
                                is to ensure your transition is as smooth as possible by providing evidence-based information and hands-on care tailored 
                                to your family’s unique needs. Whether I am offering a listening ear for your birth story, troubleshooting newborn sleep, 
                                or simply keeping your home running smoothly while you rest, I am there to bridge the gap between 'surviving' and 'thriving.' 
                                I don’t just care for your baby; I teach and support you, so you can feel confident in your own intuition.
